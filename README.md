# Rural Renting House Project

Welcome to the Rural Renting House project! This Angular application allows users to browse and rent rural houses. The project has two main views: one with front-end only and another with an API, database, and payment methods integration. Users can also view available rental dates and switch between the views using a button in the footer.



## Features

- **Front-End View**: This view provides a user-friendly interface for browsing available rural houses. Users can:
  - View house details and images.
  - Check available rental dates.
  - Navigate through listings.
  - Switch to the API-integrated view.
